        <h3> Description </h3>

        <p>This is a very famous peruvian dish. </p>
       

        <h3>Ingridients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ pounds top sirloin steak</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce, divided</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups sliced red onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4  medium roma (plum) tomato</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Slice beef horizontally into 1/4-inch strips and transfer into a mixing bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and the sugar. Mix well and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour; longer is fine.</li>


            <li>Preheat an oven to 200 degrees F (90 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with a silicone liner (such as Silpat®).</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add French fries and cook until golden and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to the prepared pan and place in the preheated oven to keep warm.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in the same skillet over high heat until the oil begins to smoke. Sear the beef strips in 2 or 3 smaller batches, until browned but still pink in places, for 1 to 2 minutes per batch. You don't want to cook the meat all the way through, as it will finish cooking with the vegetables later. As each batch of beef is browned, transfer to a plate or bowl, and reserve.</li>
            <li>Stir cilantro and crispy, cooked French fries into the pan, tossing everything to combine. Taste for salt and adjust if needed. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
